This code repo was build as a part of the kaggle competition 2 CropHarvest - crop vs. non-crop (Crop land detection from remote sensing data) IFT 6390 Machine Learning course. The goal of this project is to implement and train several classification algorithms. In this paper, we present a comparative study of different machine learning supervised classification techniques Logistic Regression, Random Forests, XGBoost and Light Gradient Boosting (LGBM). 

<!-- The code kaggle_competition_MLR_scratch.ipynb requires numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries to run and it has the implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch.

The code Kaggle_competetion_Sklearn_final.ipynb requires numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn libraries to run.

The train data(train.csv) and test data(test.csv) must be uploaded in the Google drive because I used Google Colaboratory for the entire project and it's present under Data folder.

After this you can run this Jupyter notebook.

A submission.csv file would be generated that can be uploaded to the Kaggle Competition. -->
